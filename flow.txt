1. read the input. for each line, eliminate patterns. then, reduce the text field to contain text only.
output: <year, <text, multiplier> >, eliminate lines that are from irrelevant years

2. read the input. for each line, breakdown into pairs. each pair that contains a stop-word will be eliminated, and those
that don't will be written to context: <year, < <w1, w2>, #appearences> >

3. count the pairs and single words

4. calculate PMI for each pair

5. find the best K PMIs

6. calculate the F-Measure for those K pairs, per decade
